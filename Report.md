# Report

> rovides a description of the implementation. 

## Learning Algorithm

> The report clearly describes the learning algorithm, along with the chosen hyperparameters. It also describes the model architectures for any neural networks.

## Rewards

> A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes) of at least +13. The submission reports the number of episodes needed to solve the environment. 

## Future Work

> The submission has concrete future ideas for improving the agent's performance.
